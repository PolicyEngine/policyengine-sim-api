# policyengine-simulation-api

The permanent Cloud Run front door for PolicyEngine simulation submission and
polling.

During migration Stage 5 this service is a contract-compatible control-plane
proxy backed by the existing Modal-hosted simulation gateway. It authenticates
callers, uses its own machine identity for the Modal hop, and preserves existing
job identifiers. It does not yet own job persistence, version routing, or
compute dispatch.

## Local development

    uv sync --extra test
    uv run pytest tests/ -v

The production app is policyengine_simulation_api.app:app. Required runtime
configuration is documented in policyengine_simulation_api.config.Settings.
